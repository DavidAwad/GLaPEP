[HackNY Spring 2015 Hackathon winner!](http://challengepost.com/software/glapep8)


It's very easy to ignore the minor violations of PEP8 style when the existing tools inform you about problems in such a friendly manner. GLaDOS has no time for your laziness.

## Installation

GLaPEP8 only works on OS X, because it makes use of the 'say' command.

You're going to need to supply a few files.

## Usage

./GLaPEP8.py wrong.py
